                        <p>In each application, when the mouse hovers above the dropdown component or when the Tab key
                            selects that component, the component be highlighted to show that the component is
                            selectable. Some difference are noticeable like for Google Drive, when I hovered over the
                            component there is a text that pops up, indicating the functionality of the component. This
                            was not implemented for YouTube or Unity.</p>

                        Don't be afraid to try things! For example, some questions you could think about: what happens
                        when you drag and drop text from the component, can you select part of a label of a radio
                        button? What happens when you hit Esc or PageUp while typing, will Ctrl-C copy from a popup
                        dialog, or hold down an arrow key while a menu is open?</button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The component supports various interactive functionalities, including opening and closing via
                            clicking the dropdown button, pressing Space or Enter, clicking outside the button, or
                            pressing Esc. Navigation is possible using up/down arrow keys, scrolling, hovering to
                            highlight options, and using Tab to move through items. Selection can be done by
                            left-clicking, right-clicking for more options, or pressing Enter. However, the component
                            does not support drag-and-drop, selecting partial text, copy-pasting, or adding text.</p>

                        <p>
                            The component is learnable through hover states that indicate selectability, intuitive UI
                            with clear headers, and a scrollbar for additional options. It is memorable due to frequent
                            interaction across various applications and predictable functionality that allows users to
                            navigate instinctively. In terms of efficiency, it requires only a simple click to open and
                            close, eliminates the need for page relocation, and uses logical sorting to help users
                            quickly find the desired option.</p>

            <h4>Essentially, when we hover over the dropdown arrow or the account profile, we will trigger a preview of
                the dropdown. If user clicks on the dropdown arrow the dropdown will stick. If the user directly goes
                into the dropdown box, the dropdown content will also stick and the user will still be able to use it,
                even if they did not click on the dropdown arrow in the first place. If they do not click on the arrow,
                or scroll somewhere else that is not the dropdown, the dropdown will disappear. Also, when hovered our
                dropdown is triggered, the dropdown arrow becomes blue for better visibility.</h4>
